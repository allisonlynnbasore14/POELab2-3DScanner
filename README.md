# POELab2-3DScanner
As part of POE, we create a 3D scanner with an Arduino, two servos, and a distance sensor.

* The file testValuePoelab2.ino is our Arduino 3D scan code.
* The file simpleRead.m is our MATLAB 3D scan code.

* The file OneSweep.ino is our Arduino 2D scan code.
* The file simpleReadSingleSweeep.m is our MATLAB 2D scan code.

* The file ErrorPlot.m is the code for plotting our error data points.
* The file CaibrationPOE.m is for plotting our calibration data.
